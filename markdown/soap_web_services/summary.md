12.9.Â Summary
-------------

SOAP web services are very complicated. The specification is very
ambitious and tries to cover many different use cases for web services.
This chapter has touched on some of the simpler use cases.

Before diving into the next chapter, make sure you're comfortable doing
all of these things:

-   Connecting to a SOAP server and calling remote methods
-   Loading a WSDL file and introspecting remote methods
-   Debugging SOAP calls with wire traces
-   Troubleshooting common SOAP-related errors
