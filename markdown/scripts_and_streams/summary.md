10.8. Summary
-------------

Python comes with powerful libraries for parsing and manipulating XML
documents. The `minidom` takes an XML file and parses it into Python
objects, providing for random access to arbitrary elements. Furthermore,
this chapter shows how Python can be used to create a "real" standalone
command-line script, complete with command-line flags, command-line
arguments, error handling, even the ability to take input from the piped
result of a previous program.

Before moving on to the next chapter, you should be comfortable doing
all of these things:

-   [Chaining
    programs](stdin_stdout_stderr.html "10.2. Standard input, output, and error")
    with standard input and output
-   [Defining dynamic
    dispatchers](handlers_by_node_type.html "10.5. Creating separate handlers by node type")
    with `getattr`.
-   [Using command-line
    flags](command_line_arguments.html "10.6. Handling command-line arguments")
    and validating them with `getopt`
