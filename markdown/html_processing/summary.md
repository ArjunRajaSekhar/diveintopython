8.10. Summary
-------------

Python provides you with a powerful tool, `sgmllib.py`, to manipulate
HTML by turning its structure into an object model. You can use this
tool in many different ways.

-   parsing the HTML looking for something specific
-   aggregating the results, like the [URL
    lister](extracting_data.html#dialect.extract.links "Example 8.6. Introducing urllister.py")
-   altering the structure along the way, like the [attribute
    quoter](quoting_attribute_values.html#dialect.quoting.example "Example 8.16. Quoting attribute values")
-   transforming the HTML into something else by manipulating the text
    while leaving the tags alone, like the
    [`Dialectizer`](dialect.html "8.8. Introducing dialect.py")

Along with these examples, you should be comfortable doing all of the
following things:

-   Using [`locals`() and
    `globals`()](locals_and_globals.html "8.5. locals and globals") to
    access namespaces
-   [Formatting
    strings](dictionary_based_string_formatting.html "8.6. Dictionary-based string formatting")
    using dictionary-based substitutions
