H.A. History of the software
----------------------------

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor of a
language called ABC. Guido is Python's principal author, although it
includes many contributions from others. The last version released from
CWI was Python 1.2. In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the
Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston, Virginia
where he released several versions of the software. Python 1.6 was the
last of the versions released by CNRI. In 2000, Guido and the Python
core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs
team. Python 2.0 was the first and only release from BeOpen.com.

Following the release of Python 1.6, and after Guido van Rossum left
CNRI to work with commercial software developers, it became clear that
the ability to use Python with software available under the GNU Public
License (GPL) was very desirable. CNRI and the Free Software Foundation
(FSF) interacted to develop enabling wording changes to the Python
license. Python 1.6.1 is essentially the same as Python 1.6, with a few
minor bug fixes, and with a different license that enables later
versions to be GPL-compatible. Python 2.1 is a derivative work of Python
1.6.1, as well as of Python 2.0.

After Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the
other PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations. All intellectual
property added from this point on, starting with Python 2.1 and its
alpha and beta releases, is owned by the Python Software Foundation
(PSF), a non-profit modeled after the Apache Software Foundation. See
http://www.python.org/psf/ for more information about the PSF.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.
