1.8. The Interactive Shell
--------------------------

Now that you have Python installed, what's this interactive shell thing
you're running?

It's like this: Python leads a double life. It's an interpreter for
scripts that you can run from the command line or run like applications,
by double-clicking the scripts. But it's also an interactive shell that
can evaluate arbitrary statements and expressions. This is extremely
useful for debugging, quick hacking, and testing. I even know some
people who use the Python interactive shell in lieu of a calculator!

Launch the Python interactive shell in whatever way works on your
platform, and let's dive in with the steps shown here:

### Example 1.5. First Steps in the Interactive Shell

    >>> 1 + 1               
    2
    >>> print 'hello world' 
    hello world
    >>> x = 1               
    >>> y = 2
    >>> x + y
    3

[![2](../images/callouts/2.png)](#install.shell.1.2) The interactive shell can execute arbitrary Python statements, including the **print** statement. 

[![3](../images/callouts/3.png)](#install.shell.1.3) You can also assign values to variables, and the values will be remembered as long as the shell is open (but not any longer than that).
