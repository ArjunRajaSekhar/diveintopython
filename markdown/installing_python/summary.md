1.9.Â Summary
------------

You should now have a version of Python installed that works for you.

Depending on your platform, you may have more than one version of Python
intsalled. If so, you need to be aware of your paths. If simply typing
**python** on the command line doesn't run the version of Python that
you want to use, you may need to enter the full pathname of your
preferred version.

Congratulations, and welcome to Python.
