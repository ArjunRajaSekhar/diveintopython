1.4.Â Python on Mac OS 9
-----------------------

Mac OS 9 does not come with any version of Python, but installation is
very simple, and there is only one choice.

Follow these steps to install Python on Mac OS 9:

1.  Download the `MacPython23full.bin` file from
    [http://homepages.cwi.nl/\~jack/macpython/download.html](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython/download.html).

2.  If your browser does not decompress the file automatically,
    double-click `MacPython23full.bin` to decompress the file with
    Stuffit Expander.

3.  Double-click the installer, `MacPython23full`.

4.  Step through the installer program.

5.  AFter installation is complete, close the installer and open the
    `/Applications` folder.

6.  Open the `MacPython-OS9 2.3` folder.

7.  Double-click `Python IDE` to launch Python.

The MacPython IDE should display a splash screen, and then take you to
the interactive shell. If the interactive shell does not appear, select
Window-\>Python Interactive (****Cmd**-0**). You'll see a screen like
this:

    Python 2.3 (#2, Jul 30 2003, 11:45:28)
