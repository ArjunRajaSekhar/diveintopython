17.8. Summary
-------------

You talked about several different advanced techniques in this chapter.
Not all of them are appropriate for every situation.

You should now be comfortable with all of these techniques:

-   Performing [string substitution with regular
    expressions](stage1.html "17.2. plural.py, stage 1").
-   Treating [functions as
    objects](stage2.html "17.3. plural.py, stage 2"), storing them in
    lists, assigning them to variables, and calling them through those
    variables.
-   Building [dynamic functions with
    `lambda`](stage3.html "17.4. plural.py, stage 3").
-   Building [closures](stage4.html "17.5. plural.py, stage 4"), dynamic
    functions that contain surrounding variables as constants.
-   Building [generators](stage6.html "17.7. plural.py, stage 6"),
    resumable functions that perform incremental logic and return
    different values each time you call them.

Adding abstractions, building functions dynamically, building closures,
and using generators can all make your code simpler, more readable, and
more flexible. But they can also end up making it more difficult to
debug later. It's up to you to find the right balance between simplicity
and power.
